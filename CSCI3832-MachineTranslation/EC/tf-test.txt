ID-1188	The first time visiting a city you've never been in is scary. Luckily, my friend booked me a place at embassy suites, and it wasn't so sad anymore. It has a great view from the 7th floor and the lights at night are fantastic. It's in walking distance from the North Point mall in Alpharetta, GA and I just about went there everyday. I practically spent all my money going to the mall and eating out everyday, but it was a fabulous time. The hotel itself has a beautiful interior and the one I stayed at had a free breakfast, an indoor pool and a bar. What more can you ask for? The staff at the hotel were very polite and accommodating and it was just a pleasant experience staying here. I would definitely choose this hotel again when I'm nearby and need a place to stay.

ID-0964	My wife and I decided to stay at this hotel in the Noth Shore of Minnesota for a romantic getaway. The staff was so friendly that it gave a new meaning to Minnesota nice. Our room had a wonderful view of Lake Superior, and their restaurant had the best food I have had in the region. It was conveniently located off of Highway 61 so it was really easy to find. I plan to come back soon for our next anniversary. Can't wait for it!
ID-1142	In 2010 my girlfriend and I decided to take a trip Puerto Rico as a reward to ourselves for graduating college. During the time, we were looking for vacation spots, we went on a website that offered great vacation packages. One of the packages included the Wyndham Rio Mar. My girlfrind and I immediately paid for this four night (air fair inclusive) trip. We originally did not know what to expect as the reviews for the hotel were good and bad. But this wasn't a deal breaker. Upon arrival to the Wyndham Rio Mar, we were impressed with the service, up-keep, and views from the hotel. The reviews certainly did not justice for the expereince we were about to have. The hotel was in an excellent location on th beach. We were within a mile of snorkling, horesback riding, and mountain climbing. We also wanted to travel into the city which they offered a shuttle and it was only a few miles away. The hotel also had four different restaurants within the hotle and a conference area. Overall the food was also great. The only drwaback was that is wasn't all-inclusive (Bummer). But all in all, this was an amazing experience.
ID-1247	I stayed at the Rennaissance hotel in Fort Lauderdale in October 2011. While the hotel was beautiful, I was nickled and dimed every time I turned around. For example, there was one price for the continental breakfast, and another price if you wanted a bit more food. For such an expensive hotel, I'm really shocked they couldn't have a simple, free, continental buffet. Or at least price the food comparable to market ratets.  Room service was prompt, tasty, and efficient but pricey, plus fees.  Furthermore the cost for using the internet was astronomical, and daily. I didn't even bother to try. Meanwhile a small cafe in a nearby plaza was offering free internet to its patrons.   Maybe this is a feature of more upscale hotels. Everything is lovely but be sure you're going to pay for it.
